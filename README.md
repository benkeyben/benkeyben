## About Me
Hi there! 👋 I work with 10Alytics as a Data Specialist. My name is Benjamin Yankey. With the use of programs like MySQL, Microsoft Excel, Power BI, Tableau, AWS, and Python, I am passionate about harnessing Big Data to optimize corporate projects. I also create strong ETL pipelines and use Apache Airflow to coordinate data workflows as part of my experience in data engineering. In my free time, I like to explore new technologies and delve into data-driven insights. 🚀

## What I Do
Data engineering and analysis are my areas of expertise. I use big data technology and cutting edge methods like DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to improve data-driven insights and guide important business decisions. My expertise includes creating user-friendly dashboards and putting powerful data visualizations into practice to promote comprehension and produce results that can be put into action. I enjoy taking on challenging problems and providing scalable solutions that support business expansion. This includes everything from developing effective ETL pipelines to coordinating complicated data workflows. 💼

## My Projects
The following are some of my most notable recent projects:

- **CyclicInsight Dashboard**: Developed a complete business intelligence (BI) solution for StarBoard Adventures. Using Power BI Desktop, I was able to provide executives with user-friendly dashboards that allowed them to monitor key performance indicators and assess market trends. 📊

- **Candidalysis**: Developed a project with the goal of utilizing Power BI to analyze student performance for the academic year 2022–2023, with an emphasis on obtaining, displaying, and interpreting key performance indicators (KPIs) associated with tests given during this time. 📚

- **10Alytics Air Realtor**: Using Amazon S3, EC2, Apache Airflow, and an AWS-driven data pipeline, 10Alytics Air Realtor was established as a dynamic repository to facilitate effective ETL processes. Using RapidAPI, this program retrieves extensive real estate data from the Realty Mole Property API, giving real estate professionals fast insights for tactical decision-making. 🏡
